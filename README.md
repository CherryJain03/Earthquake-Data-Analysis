# Earthquake-Data-Analysis

  A MATLAB programme to handle, sort, filter and analyse the large scale earthquake data. It can filter out the data according to depth, magnitude and region (in this particular example - only 3 region's of Gujarat are taken into consideration according to their latitude and langitude divide into - Kacchh, Saurashtra and Mainland.
  It has a User Interface on the Software where you can enter your preferences for the same and it automatically gives you various histogrames and plots for a better understanding of the data and gain more information about the events without even looking into the data.
  The Code can be worked on to include more Analysis figures and other features. This particular peice was the part of my Internship at Institute of Seismological Research's Catalogue Analysis and thus the data should not be made accessible.
